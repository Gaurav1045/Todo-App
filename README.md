# 📝 To-Do App  

A simple and interactive **To-Do App** built using **React + Vite**. This application helps users manage tasks efficiently by adding, completing, and deleting them.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Task Input**: Enter a task and its due date.  
- **Dynamic Add Button**: The "Add" button appears only after input.  
- **Pending & Completed Sections**: View tasks under "Pending" and move them to "Completed" upon finishing.  
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks from any section.  
- **React State Management**: Uses React's state to handle task data dynamically.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React + Vite  
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState)  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `src/` - Contains React components.  
- `App.jsx` - Manages state and renders components.  
- `TaskInput.jsx` - Handles task input fields.  
- `TaskList.jsx` - Displays tasks in pending and completed sections.  

## 🎯 How to Run  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gaurav1045/todo-app.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:  
   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server**:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open **http://localhost:5173/** in your browser.  

## 🖥️ Example Workflow  
1. Enter a task and select a date.  
2. Click the "Add" button to save the task.  
3. View the task under the "Pending" section.  
4. Mark it as **Completed** when done.  
5. Delete a task if no longer needed.  

## 🏗️ Future Improvements  
- Add local storage support to save tasks.
